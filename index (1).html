<p>Space rovers, also known as planetary rovers or just rovers, are devices designed to examine the surface of planets and other celestial bodies. Some of them are used as transport for a human spaceflight crew, while others are autonomous to some degree. At the moment, the only places humans have sent rovers are the Moon and Mars. <sub>[1]</sub></sub></p>
<p>They collect information by taking pictures with panoramic and microscopic cameras.<sub>[2]</sub> They also make temperature readings with a thermal emission spectrometer, which produces infrared scans of the surface.<sub>[3]</sub> Lastly, they use a big arm that drills rock, and then uses a smaller arm to move the samples to the drill. <sub>[2]</sub></p>
<p>Space rovers have six aluminum wheels, each with its own motor. They have cleats for traction, and titanium spokes for support. There are models that don't use wheels as transportation, but there are very few. They receive their energy from the Sun via solar panels.<sub>[3]</sub></p>
<p>The most well-known rovers are Curiosity and Perserverence. NASA successfully landed Curiosity on Mars' surface in August 2012, with the objective of determining whether Mars could support life. Perserverence landed on Mars in 2021, and was mainly investigating its past geology.<sub>[4]</sub></p>
